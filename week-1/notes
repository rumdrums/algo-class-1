** fundamental question for every algorithm designer: CAN WE DO BETTER? **
Integer multiplication
. Input
 -- two n-digit numbers x and y
. Output
 -- the product x*y
. The usual approach to solving multiplication by hand requires roughly 2n^2 operations, 
  each increase of n results in factor of 2 increase in number of operations (quadratic)

. but, Karatsuba multiplication... 
 -- x*y = 10^n*ac + 10^(n/2)(ad+bc) + bd
 -- a,b and c,d are result of dividing x and y, respectively, into smaller numbers
 -- come up with recursive algorithm for this
